Weather Data Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project builds a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify weather conditions (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Fog, Rain) using meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

🚀 Features

Data loading and inspection

Handling missing values using SimpleImputer

Categorical encoding with LabelEncoder

Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

Decision Tree Classifier with depth comparison

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

User-defined prediction function for custom input

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📊 Model Insights

Explored how Decision Tree depth affects overfitting and generalization.

Found optimal depth providing the best tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.
